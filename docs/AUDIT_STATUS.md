# Kyro IDE – Audit Status

**Last updated:** 2025-03

## Summary

- **Vision:** Lightest AI-native IDE; compete with VS Code, Antigravity, Cursor using **local-only** LLMs and agents; **Atoms-of-Thought** reasoning; **AirLLM + browser + Ollama**; **n8n** automation development (GLM5, Kimi K2.5).
- **Canonical plan:** [KYRO_IDE_2026_ENGINEERING_PLAN.md](KYRO_IDE_2026_ENGINEERING_PLAN.md)
- **Cleanup:** [CLEANUP_CANDIDATES.md](CLEANUP_CANDIDATES.md)

## What Was Done

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| README | Updated for Kyro IDE; local-only AI, AoT, n8n, browser, GLM5/Kimi K2.5, lightest IDE. |
| 2026 plan | Part 0 (differentiators), Part 2 (vision table), Part 3 (tech map), Stage 4.6–4.7 (large models, AoT), Stage 5.5 (browser + n8n), Part 7 (success criteria). |
| CLEANUP_CANDIDATES | Refreshed; canonical plan and extension command naming noted. |
| Orchestrator | missions.rs present; orchestrator wired in main/lib/commands; duplicate Tauri commands resolved. |
| package.json | `test` script added (`vitest run`) for frontend unit tests. |

## Build & Test Status

| Check | Notes |
|-------|------|
| **Rust (`cargo build`)** | Pre-existing errors in LSP, yrs, chrono, tree-sitter, sysinfo, AgentStore, etc. Stage 1 is to fix until clean build. |
| **Frontend (`bun run build`)** | Run locally to confirm. |
| **Frontend (`bun run lint`)** | Run locally to confirm. |
| **Frontend (`bun run test`)** | Vitest; run locally to confirm. |

## Files Not Deleted

- No source or docs were removed in this audit. `docs/status/archive/*` and older engineering plans are kept for history. See CLEANUP_CANDIDATES for future removal candidates (after review).

## Next Steps

1. **Stage 1:** Fix Rust compilation (see “Current issues” in the 2026 plan).
2. Run `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, `bun run build` and fix any failures.
3. Implement Stage 2+ (UX, LSP, local AI, AoT, browser, n8n) per the 2026 plan.
